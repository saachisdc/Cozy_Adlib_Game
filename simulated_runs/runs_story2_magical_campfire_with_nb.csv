The fire shifted its weight, settling more uncomfortably against my arms, and I realized with a jolt that I was instinctively rocking it like a restless infant. The van was just big enough for me and Sparky, my navigator and pet dog. He sniffed at the open page of my chosen tale but decided to hop down and explore the leaf-litter nearby. My eyes drifted over to a roaring dog pacing in tight circles near the van, his shadow stretched enormous and theatrical against the trees, as though he were auditioning for very serious nature documentary.

From the back of the van, I grabbed a small  stack of books  from the shelf on top of my fold out bed and took the books outside, perching on the porch seat as the van creaked softly behind me. The paper smelled faintly of dust and glue, grounding me in the simple pleasure of reading for no reason other than wanting to. The van was just big enough for me and Sparky, my navigator and pet dog. He rested his chin briefly on my knee, then wandered off to investigate a particularly interesting puddle, radiating the calm confidence of a very normal dog.

An unsettling tower of paper and glue that rustled softly, radiating expectations and a quiet disapproval like an overbearing parent I could not escape. My eyes drifted over to a roaring stack of books, impossibly tall and flickering with printed words that burned, rearranged themselves, and burned again, demanding to be read, no matter how boring.

From the back of the van, I grabbed a small  stack of books  from the shelf on top of my fold out bed and crawled out the back doors of the van to sit on the pull-out porch seat.
