The van was just big enough for me and Sparky, my navigator and pet stack of books. A sentient stack of books that leaned subtly toward me, their spines creaking as if stretching, insisting through sheer presence that this was completely normal now. My eyes drifted over to a roaring dog outside my camper window. Except it was clearly a lion; I wisely kept my camper van doors shut.

From the back of the van, I grabbed a small  dog  from the shelf on top of my fold out bed and paused, trying to remember when I had last placed a dog on a shelf. He stretched lazily, unfazed, as though this was a perfectly reasonable storage solution. The van was just big enough for me and Sparky, my navigator and pet stack of books. An unsettling tower of paper and glue that rustled softly, radiating expectations and a quiet disapproval like an overbearing parent I could not escape. My eyes drifted over to a roaring campfire, safely surrounded  by a ring of rocks, that snapped and crackled pleasingly.
